#### **Hour 4: Mapping the DevOps Lifecycle**

#### **Concepts: DevOps Value Stream**

In this session, we will focus on mapping the **DevOps lifecycle** through its various stages. The DevOps value stream helps to visualize how value flows from idea to deployment, ensuring continuous feedback and improvement. The stages of the lifecycle include:

1. **Planning**: Teams collaborate on defining requirements, objectives, and user stories. Agile methodologies like Scrum are often used in this stage to set sprint goals and prioritize backlog items.

2. **Coding**: Developers work on writing the actual code. Best practices like version control (Git) and coding standards ensure that code is maintained efficiently.

3. **Building**: The code is built and packaged into deployable units (e.g., Docker images, JAR files). Continuous integration tools like Jenkins automate this process, ensuring that new code integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.

4. **Testing**: Automated testing, such as unit tests, integration tests, and security tests, are run to validate the quality and security of the code. Test automation tools like Selenium and JUnit are often integrated into the CI pipeline.

5. **Deploying**: Once tested, the code is deployed into different environments (staging, production) using continuous delivery pipelines. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Spinnaker help automate this process, ensuring fast and reliable deployments.

6. **Monitoring**: After deployment, the system is monitored for performance, security vulnerabilities, and errors. Monitoring tools like Prometheus, ELK Stack, and AWS CloudWatch help ensure that any issues are detected and resolved in real-time.

7. **Feedback**: Continuous feedback from users and system monitoring feeds into the next planning cycle, enabling teams to improve both the software and the processes continuously.

#### **Explaining the Concept Using Diagrams Over My Whiteboard**

I will explain the complete **DevOps lifecycle** on my whiteboard, illustrating how each stage (Planning, Coding, Building, Testing, Deploying, Monitoring, Feedback) connects and overlaps. This visual representation will help participants understand how the DevOps value stream promotes continuous delivery and improvement.

The diagram will also highlight the tools and practices commonly used at each stage, such as:
- **Jira** for planning and managing user stories.
- **Git** for version control during coding.
- **Jenkins** for continuous integration during the build phase.
- **Selenium** for testing automation.
- **Kubernetes** and **Docker** for deploying containerized applications.
- **Prometheus** and **ELK Stack** for monitoring.

#### **Hands-on Lab: Mapping the DevOps Lifecycle onto a Sample Project**

For this lab, participants will work in teams to map the DevOps lifecycle onto a sample project. The steps they will follow include:

1. **Planning Stage**: Define user stories and tasks for a small project (e.g., an e-commerce site with basic functionalities like browsing products, adding to cart, and checkout).

2. **Coding Stage**: Each team will assign tasks such as writing code for a new feature (e.g., product search functionality). Participants will simulate this stage by planning how they will collaborate using version control (Git).

3. **Building Stage**: Teams will simulate building a Docker container or creating an artifact using a build tool like Maven. No actual code will be built, but teams will outline the steps required to package their application.

4. **Testing Stage**: Participants will map out which types of automated tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) they would implement to validate their code before deployment.

5. **Deploying Stage**: Teams will simulate how they would deploy the application using Jenkins or Kubernetes. Participants will describe the pipeline steps required to move the code from staging to production.

6. **Monitoring Stage**: Teams will discuss how they would set up monitoring to track performance, errors, and security vulnerabilities in their application.

7. **Feedback Stage**: Participants will consider how feedback from users and monitoring would be used to plan the next iteration of the project.

**Lab Objective**:
- By the end of this lab, participants will have a clear understanding of how each stage in the DevOps lifecycle fits together. They will also have mapped out the DevOps pipeline for a small-scale project, making it easier to implement similar processes in their own work environments.

This session will provide participants with both a theoretical and practical understanding of the DevOps lifecycle.
