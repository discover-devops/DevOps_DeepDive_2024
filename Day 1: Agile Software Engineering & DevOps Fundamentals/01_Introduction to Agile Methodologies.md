### **Day 1: Agile Software Engineering & DevOps Fundamentals**

#### **Hour 1: Introduction to Agile Methodologies**

#### **Concepts: Agile Principles and Values**

Start by explaining the four core values and twelve principles of the **Agile Manifesto**, which focus on:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
- **Responding to change** over following a plan.

These principles guide teams in delivering working software frequently and adapting to change.

#### **Scrum Overview**

**Scrum** is a popular Agile framework that breaks down work into short iterations called **sprints** (usually 2â€“4 weeks). The main elements of Scrum include:

- **Roles**: 
  - **Scrum Master**: Facilitator ensuring the team follows Agile principles.
  - **Product Owner**: Defines the product backlog and prioritizes work.
  - **Development Team**: Cross-functional members responsible for delivering increments of the product.
  
- **Artifacts**:
  - **Product Backlog**: Ordered list of work needed for the product.
  - **Sprint Backlog**: Selected items from the Product Backlog for the current sprint.
  - **Increment**: The final output of a sprint, ideally a potentially shippable product.

- **Events**:
  - **Sprint Planning**: Define goals and tasks for the sprint.
  - **Daily Stand-ups**: Short meetings for team members to discuss progress and challenges.
  - **Sprint Review**: Present what was completed during the sprint.
  - **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on the sprint and discuss areas for improvement.

#### **Kanban Overview**

**Kanban** is another Agile framework focused on visualizing workflow and limiting work in progress. It is less structured than Scrum and follows these key principles:

- **Visualize the workflow**: Use Kanban boards to show work stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Limit work in progress (WIP)**: Restrict the number of tasks that can be in each stage at once to prevent bottlenecks.
- **Continuous flow**: Unlike Scrum, work is continuous without defined iterations.
- **Continuous improvement**: Teams continuously analyze and improve the process.

#### **Conceptual Diagram (Scrum vs. Kanban)**

I'll explain this at my white board **Drawio diagram** that compares Scrum and Kanban, showing key elements like sprints, roles, and backlog for Scrum, and workflow visualization, WIP limits for Kanban. I can help guide you through creating it if needed.

#### **Activity: Group Discussion on the Benefits of Agile**

You can engage participants by asking them to discuss the following:

1. **How Agile improves software development**: Focus on adaptability, customer feedback, and frequent delivery.
2. **Challenges of traditional project management vs. Agile**: Discuss how Agile addresses issues like changing requirements or project timelines.
3. **Scrum vs. Kanban**: Ask participants when they would use Scrum vs. Kanban in real-world scenarios.

This framework for **Hour 1** should set a strong foundation for Agile methodologies.
