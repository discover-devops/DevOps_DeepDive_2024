### **Day 1: Agile Software Engineering & DevOps Fundamentals**

#### **Hour 2: User Stories & Agile Estimation Techniques**

#### **Concepts: User Stories**

**User stories** are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the end user or customer. They help teams break down the work into manageable pieces. A standard format for writing user stories is:

- **As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit].**

For example:
- *As a customer, I want to search for products by category so that I can find items easily.*

Key characteristics of user stories:
- **Independent**: Can be completed independently of other stories.
- **Negotiable**: Stories are not contracts; they can evolve based on feedback.
- **Valuable**: Each story delivers value to the customer.
- **Estimable**: The team can estimate the effort required to complete the story.
- **Small**: Stories are small enough to be completed within a sprint.
- **Testable**: Each story should have acceptance criteria that guide how it will be validated.

#### **Backlog Management**

A **product backlog** is a prioritized list of user stories, tasks, and features that need to be completed for the product. The backlog is dynamic and can change based on feedback, new requirements, or changes in priorities.

The **Product Owner** is responsible for managing and prioritizing the backlog, ensuring that the most important stories are addressed first. Some key concepts for backlog management include:

- **Backlog Refinement**: Continuous process of updating and improving the backlog.
- **Prioritization**: Product Owners prioritize stories based on customer needs, business value, and effort required.
- **Sprint Backlog**: Stories that have been selected for development in the current sprint.

#### **Agile Estimation Techniques**

Estimation in Agile focuses on **relative sizing** rather than precise time estimates. Two popular techniques are:

1. **Story Points**:
   - **Story points** are a relative measure of effort required to complete a user story. The team assigns points to stories based on their complexity, risk, and effort. Story points help teams focus on the amount of work rather than time estimates.
   - Typical scales: Fibonacci series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.), powers of 2, or t-shirt sizing (S, M, L, XL).

2. **Planning Poker**:
   - A fun, collaborative technique where team members use cards with numbers (story points) to estimate the effort of a user story. Each member shows their card at the same time, and any differences are discussed until a consensus is reached.
   - Benefits: Encourages team collaboration and discussion, and prevents bias from influencing estimates.

#### **Conceptual Diagram (Backlog Management and Estimation)**

I'll explain this at my white board with the help of diagram showing:
- The structure of a product backlog (with user stories, epics, tasks).
- A flow diagram of how user stories move from the product backlog to sprint backlog.
- Planning Poker and Story Points visualization, showing how teams use these techniques during sprint planning.

#### **Hands-on Lab: Defining User Stories and Estimating Effort**

For this lab, split participants into teams and provide them with a sample project (e.g., building an e-commerce website). Have them:

1. **Define User Stories**:
   - Each team writes 3â€“5 user stories using the format discussed earlier (As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]).

2. **Estimate Effort**:
   - Use **Planning Poker** to estimate the effort required for each story. Give each team member a set of story point cards and have them estimate in rounds.
   - Discuss discrepancies and reach a consensus on story points for each story.

**Lab Objectives**:
- Ensure participants understand how to write effective user stories.
- Help teams practice collaborative estimation techniques (Planning Poker).
- Reinforce the importance of backlog prioritization.

This hour will provide a deeper understanding of user stories and Agile estimation techniques while reinforcing collaboration.
